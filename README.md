- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaWe99
- 👀 I’m interested in all things nerdy essentially. Everything is interesting if you take an interest isnt it? But mostly, I like TV-shows and good company.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Web Development with Mittuniversitetet in Sweden. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something in the future! Right now I'm just focused on keeping up with assignments and soaking up all the knowledge I can.
- 📫 How to reach me: e-mail: matilda.wernstedt@gmail.com
